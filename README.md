CIS 700 course project

This project presents a full-stack motion planning and control framework for robotic block stacking using a simulated 6-DOF robotic arm (Poppy Ergo Jr) in PyBullet. It combines analytical and numerical inverse kinematics, trajectory control, and a tower rearrangement planner optimized with A* search.

## Project Objectives

- Simulate a 6-DOF robotic arm using PyBullet
- Implement inverse and forward kinematics
- Design a rule-based tower rearrangement planner
- Perform collision-free motion planning with optimized A*
- Evaluate block stacking accuracy and reliability
- Experiment with RRT* for trajectory exploration

## Features

- Inverse Kinematics with L-BFGS-B optimization
- Rule-based tower rearrangement with auxiliary storage
- A* and RRT* path planning algorithms
- Real-time joint-space control and grasping
- Detailed visualization using PyBullet and OpenCV
- Tower abstraction and block placement optimization

## How It Works
- IK Solver: Uses L-BFGS-B to compute joint angles that match a target 6D pose.
- Tower Planner: Encodes scene state into stacks; determines which block to move and where.
- Move Optimization: A* minimizes redundant transfers.
- Simulation: Executes motion with joint-space interpolation and grasp logic.
